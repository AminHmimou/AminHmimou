# About Me 👋

💻 **Data Engineer** | 🌩️ **Cloud** & 🗂️ **Big Data Enthusiast**

🔍 **Who I Am**:

I am a passionate data engineer graduated from École Polytechnique de Marseille. I specialize in building robust **ETL pipelines**, optimizing 🌐 **cloud infrastructures**, and creating impactful 📊 **data solutions**. When I'm not trying to explain to my family that I don't fix printers, I'm probably debugging a pipeline or telling my data to "spark" joy! My idea of fun? Building efficient data pipelines and making cloud infrastructures work smarter, not harder. Think of me as a data architect who believes that good data tells a story, but great data tells the truth.


🛠️ **Technical Expertise**:
* 💻 **Programming**: Python, PySpark, SQL, R
* ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**: Microsoft Azure, GCP, AWS (S3, Glue, Athena, Lambda)
* 🛠️ **Big Data Tools**: PySpark, Delta Lake, Snowflake
* 🗄️ **ETL & Warehousing**: Azure Data Factory, Informatica, SSIS, Azure Synapse
* 📊 **Visualization**: Power BI, Looker Studio, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* 🤖 **Data Science**: Pandas, Machine Learning, NLP, Sklearn

🌟 **Data Journey** (or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data"):

* **BI & Data Engineer @ EDF Renewables (2024)**: 
   * Making cloud costs disappear faster than my coffee ☕
   * Learned that optimizing ETL pipelines is like solving a puzzle, except the pieces keep changing
   * Master of turning messy data into beautiful dashboards (aka "data makeup artist") 

* **ML Research Intern @ Polytechnic University of Valencia (2023)**:
   * Teaching machines to predict text (because humans are too unpredictable)
   * Discovered that NLP is just teaching computers to read, but with more math
   * Became fluent in Python, Pytorch, and debugging console outputs 🐛

* **Data Engineer @ DataValue Consulting (2022)**:
   * Azure wizard-in-training 🧙‍♂️
   * Learned that solar panel data is actually pretty cool (when it's not cloudy)
   * Discovered that real-time monitoring is just like watching Netflix, but with numbers

📚 **Certifications & Education**:
* 🎓 IBM Data Analyst with Python (because regular Python wasn't challenging enough)
* 🎓 Apache Spark SQL for Data Analysts (Databricks)
* 📊 Power BI Data Analyst Associate (In Progress)
* 🎓 Engineering Degree in Industrial and Computer Engineering (2021-2024)

🌱 **Currently Exploring**: 
* Advanced 📐 data modeling techniques (making data look pretty)
* ⚡ Real-time data processing architectures (because waiting is so 2020)
* 🔄 Modern ETL/ELT patterns (Extract, Transform, Love)
* 🤖 MLOps practices (teaching robots to deploy themselves)

✨ **Let's Connect**: Looking for someone to nerd out about data with? I'm your person! When I'm not transforming data, I'm transforming coffee into code. ☕→💻
